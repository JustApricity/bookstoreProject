the edit.pug in book could very well break, I'm unsure of how exactly to fix it. Slide for this is 24 on the first powerpoint
Line 26 on view_all in book could also break
bookForm might break, the mixin itself
view_all on in author might be singular author and not authors for '/authors/add'

remember to edit the length and height a row can have in the description of bookForm
